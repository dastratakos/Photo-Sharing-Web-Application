<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

In May and June of 2020, I created a photo sharing web application over the
course of four project submissions for
[CS 142: Web Applications](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs142/projects.html),
a course taught at Stanford University. The application has similar
functionality to that of Facebook, Instagram, and other popular social media
platforms. At a high level, this application is a site where users can post
photos, comment on and like others' posts, save a favorites list of posts, see
community activity, and more.

This application uses the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
All of the processes are run locally on one machine, meaning that the website
is not hosted online. However, I might explore making those upgrades later down
the road.

Note that, due to the
[Stanford Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code),
I have not made my code publicly available.

## Demo

Here are a video and screenshots of the app in action. The user can choose to
be in normal mode (orange) or advanced mode (purple).

demonstrate a handful of the latest features that I added.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### Project 8
#### Wed, June 10, 2020
* [x] Users can mention other users in comments with the `@` symbol.
* [x] User profile includes a photo grid with information such as number of
      likes and the time posted.
* [x] There is an Activity feed to show the 20 latest activities on the site.
* [x] Responsive design for different devices and screen sizes.
* [x] Users can like and unlike posts.
* [x] Users can edit and delete comments that they authored.
* [x] Users can favorite posts and view their saved posts in the Favorites tab.
      Clicking on a favorite post will display a larger modal.

### Project 7
#### Tues, June 2, 2020
* [x] Sessions and input allows for multiple users with unique logins. New
      users can register with a new profile.
* [x] The login page has a smooth animation between the log in and sign up
      sections.
* [x] Users can comment on photos.
* [x] Users can upload new photos.
* [x] Passwords are salted for additional security.
* [x] The app remembers who is logged in even after the browser is refreshed.

### Project 6
#### Thurs, May 21, 2020
* [x] The web server uses a MongoDB database instead.
* [x] The [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) npm package is used to
      support RESTful API.
* [x] There is an advanced mode that can be toggled on and off. Advanced mode
      allows users to see how many posts and comments each user has made from
      the `UserList`.

### Project 5
#### Thurs, May 14, 2020
* [x] The single page application includes a `UserList`, `UserDetail`,
      `UserPhotos`, and `TopBar` components.
* [x] Styling is done using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components.
* [x] The model data consists of four types of objects: `user`, `photo`,
      `comment`, and `SchemaInfo`.
* [x] A web server allows model data to be fetched.
* [x] Users can view photos one at a time with a stepper view, which is useful
      for users with a large number of photos.
